# forgefs -- The Keyforge Filesystem

Finally!  A filesystem that lets you browse all Keyforge cards and all
the decks you have registered at
[decksofkeyforge.com](https://decksofkeyforge.com).  forgefs is a
filesystem that runs on Ubuntu and MacOS that shows up like a thumb
drive, letting you browse both cards and decks from the command line
or in your file broswer.

## Usage

Here is an example of browsing the filesystem on Linux.  In this
example, we show:

1. Listing all Keyforge cards from the command line, then showing the
   card data and image for one card.
2. Doing the same thing, from the GUI file browser.
3. Listing all your decksofkeyforge decks, then showing the deck data
   for one of them.
4. Generate a PDF of all the cards in the deck on the fly using a
   standard Linux tool.
